Note 2: Coffee Houses and the Age of Enlightenment
The spread of coffee houses across Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries coincided with and contributed to the Age of Enlightenment. In England, coffee houses were nicknamed "penny universities" because for the price of a coffee, patrons could engage in intellectual discussions and access the latest newspapers and pamphlets. Lloyd's of London, now a famous insurance market, began as Edward Lloyd's Coffee House, where merchants and sailors gathered to discuss maritime news and insurance deals.
These establishments fostered a new kind of public sphere where ideas could be freely exchanged and debated. The collaborative atmosphere of coffee houses contributed to scientific advancement, literary creation, and political discourse. The French Revolution was partly planned in Parisian caf√©s, while the American Revolution gained momentum in Boston's coffee houses. The relationship between caffeine consumption and intellectual activity became intrinsically linked to the progression of modern thought and social change.
