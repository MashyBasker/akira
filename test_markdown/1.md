Note 1: The Ethiopian Origins and Early Coffee Trade
The story of coffee begins in the Ethiopian highlands, where the Coffea arabica plant originated. According to local legend, a goat herder named Kaldi first discovered coffee's stimulating effects when he noticed his goats becoming energetic after eating the berries from certain bushes. By the 15th century, coffee was being grown in Yemen's Sufi monasteries, where it was used to aid concentration during religious ceremonies. The port of Mocha became the center of the world's coffee trade, creating a monopoly that would last for centuries.
The Ottoman Empire played a crucial role in spreading coffee culture beyond Arabia. Ottoman traders established coffee houses in Constantinople and other major cities, creating new social spaces that would revolutionize public discourse and intellectual exchange. These coffee houses became known as "Schools of the Wise," where people from different social classes could gather to discuss politics, literature, and philosophy, laying the groundwork for future cultural transformations.
